Breakdown of key files and folders

Index.html: This file is the entry point of your application. This is where the react app is mounted, and Vite injects the necessary scripts to load the app.
src/: The src folder contains all your application code.
main.jsx: This is the main entry point for the React app. It imports React, renders the root component (App.jsx), and attaches it to the #root element in the index.html file.
App.jsx: This is the root component of your application, where you start building your UI. You can modify this file to add more components as the project grows.
vite.config.js: Allows you to customise Vite's behaviour, add plugins, or modify the build process.
